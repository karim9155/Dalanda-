\section{Context}
Invoice management is a cornerstone of any company's long-term viability, especially for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that form the backbone of the economy. Accurate and timely invoicing is not only a legal obligation but is also crucial for maintaining healthy cash flow, ensuring regulatory compliance, and preserving good customer relationships.

However, many SMEs and self-employed individuals still rely on manual processes to manage this critical part of their operations. Using spreadsheets like Excel or Word documents to create, track, and archive invoices is a common practice. While functional on a small scale, these methods quickly reveal their limitations: they are time-consuming, prone to human error (miscalculations, forgotten VAT, incorrect invoice numbers), and offer limited traceability. Tracking payments becomes a tedious task, increasing the risk of delays and defaults that can weaken a company's financial stability.

In parallel, the professional world is undergoing a rapid digital transformation. Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions have emerged, offering invoicing tools of varying complexity. However, these solutions can be costly, oversized for the actual needs of small organizations, or lacking in flexibility. Moreover, adopting a new tool often presents a barrier, requiring a learning curve and the migration of existing data.

In this landscape, a key trend is emerging: the integration of work tools into daily communication flows. Instant messaging applications like Telegram are no longer just for discussion but are becoming genuine productivity platforms. The rise of conversational assistants, powered by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), is paving the way for more intuitive and accessible interactions. It is within this context that the Dalanda project is positioned: addressing the need for a modern, simple, and efficient invoicing solution that integrates with current mobile usage habits.

\section{Problem Statement}
The central problem of this project stems directly from the context described. SMEs and independent workers face a dilemma: either they continue with manual invoicing methods, thereby accepting inefficiency, the risk of errors, and the associated mental load; or they invest in off-the-shelf invoicing software that is often unsuitable, either due to its prohibitive cost or its unnecessary complexity.

The core of the problem can be broken down into several friction points:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accessibility and Cost:} Comprehensive software solutions represent a significant investment, often in the form of monthly subscriptions, which can be a barrier for a startup or a freelancer.
    \item \textbf{Complexity and Learning Curve:} Many invoicing software packages are designed for larger companies and include a plethora of features (inventory management, advanced accounting, etc.) that are unnecessary for a small business. This complexity leads to a cluttered interface and a steep learning curve that discourages adoption.
    \item \textbf{Wasted Time and Manual Errors:} Manually creating invoices in spreadsheets or word processors is repetitive and prone to data entry mistakes, VAT calculation errors, or numbering issues, which can have legal and financial consequences. Tracking due dates and payments is also a source of stress and wasted time.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Mobility and Immediacy:} Processes based on office files are not well-suited for mobile use. Creating or viewing an invoice from a smartphone is often cumbersome, yet responsiveness is a key part of the client relationship.
    \item \textbf{Context Switching:} Invoice management typically occurs outside of the communication channels where business is discussed. A client might request a quote on Telegram, the conversation continues over email, and the invoice is ultimately generated in another software. This fragmentation of processes undermines efficiency.
\end{itemize}

The problem statement is therefore as follows: How can we provide small businesses with an invoicing tool that is powerful, easy to access, affordable, and seamlessly integrates into their daily digital communication habits to reduce administrative friction and accelerate the billing cycle? This project aims to answer this question by proposing a solution that combines the robustness of a web application with the simplicity of a conversational interface.
\section{Project Objectives}
% List the objectives clearly.
The main objective of this project, named \textbf{Dalanda}, is to design and develop a complete invoice management solution. The sub-objectives are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a robust and secure RESTful API with Spring Boot.
    \item Develop an intuitive and responsive single-page web interface (SPA) with Angular.
    \item Implement a conversational assistant on Telegram capable of understanding and executing commands in natural language.
    \item Orchestrate the assistant's logic using the n8n automation platform.
    \item Ensure the deployment of the solution using Docker.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Sprint 1: Backend Foundation and Core API}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter details the work carried out during the first sprint, which focused on establishing the technical foundation of the backend application. The primary goals were to set up the Spring Boot project, implement a robust security layer, and develop the core APIs for user and client management.

\section{Sprint Backlog}
The backlog for this sprint included the following user stories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As a user, I want to register for an account so I can access the service.
    \item As a user, I want to log in securely to the application to protect my data.
    \item As a developer, I need a project structure with proper dependency management (Maven).
    \item As an authenticated user, I want to create, read, update, and delete clients.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design and Implementation}
\subsection{Project Setup}
The project was initialized using Spring Initializr with Java 17, Maven, and key dependencies like Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Security.

\subsection{Security Implementation}
A security layer using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) was implemented. This involved creating a `JwtTokenProvider` to generate and validate tokens, and configuring Spring Security to protect endpoints, requiring authentication for all API calls except for registration and login.

\subsection{API Development}
The following core endpoints were developed and tested:
\begin{itemize}
    \item `POST /api/auth/register`
    \item `POST /api/auth/login`
    \item `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /api/clients`
\end{itemize}

\section{Sprint Review}
At the end of the sprint, the backend was functional, with a secure authentication system and a complete CRUD API for client management. The main challenge was correctly configuring the JWT security filter chain.

    \label{fig:sprint1_burndown}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Sprint 2: Frontend Implementation and Entity Management}
\section{Introduction}
The second sprint was dedicated to building the frontend application using Angular. The main objectives were to create the user interface for authentication, as well as for managing clients and companies, and to connect these components to the backend API developed in Sprint 1.

\section{Sprint Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item As a user, I want a web page to register and log in.
    \item As a logged-in user, I want to see a dashboard where I can manage my data.
    \item As a user, I want a user-friendly interface to add, view, edit, and delete my clients.
    \item As a user, I want to be able to manage my company's details, including uploading a logo and a stamp.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design and Implementation}
\subsection{Angular Project Setup}
An Angular project was created using the Angular CLI. Angular Material was chosen for UI components to ensure a consistent and professional look.

\subsection{Authentication UI}
Login and registration forms were created. An `AuthService` was implemented to handle communication with the backend, and an HTTP interceptor was used to attach the JWT token to all subsequent requests.

\subsection{Client and Company Management UI}
CRUD interfaces for clients and companies were developed. This included creating forms for data entry and tables to display the existing data. Services were created to interact with the `/api/clients` and `/api/companies` endpoints.

\section{Sprint Review}
By the end of this sprint, a functional frontend was in place. Users could register, log in, and manage their clients and company information. The main challenge was mastering reactive forms in Angular for complex data structures.

    \label{fig:sprint2_burndown}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Sprint 3: Invoice Management and PDF Generation}
\section{Introduction}
This sprint focused on the core functionality of the application: invoice management. The goals were to implement the backend logic and frontend interface for creating and managing invoices, as well as the ability to generate PDF versions of these invoices.

\section{Sprint Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item As a user, I want to create a new invoice with multiple line items, taxes, and due dates.
    \item As a user, I want to view a list of all my invoices and see their status (e.g., paid, pending).
    \item As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete existing invoices.
    \item As a user, I want to download a PDF version of any invoice for my records or to send to a client.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design and Implementation}
\subsection{Backend Invoice API}
The Spring Boot application was extended with a new set of endpoints under `/api/invoices` for full CRUD functionality. A service layer was created to handle the business logic, such as calculating totals and managing invoice statuses.

\subsection{PDF Generation}
The iTextPDF library was integrated into the backend. A `PdfGeneratorService` was created to take invoice data and generate a professional-looking PDF document, including the company logo and other details.

\subsection{Frontend Invoice UI}
The Angular application was updated with a new module for invoice management. This included a complex reactive form for creating and editing invoices, especially for handling a dynamic list of invoice items using `FormArray`.

\section{Sprint Review}
The core feature of the application was completed in this sprint. Users could now manage the entire lifecycle of an invoice. The PDF generation proved challenging, especially with regard to layout and styling.

    \label{fig:sprint3_burndown}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Sprint 4: Conversational Assistant and n8n Integration}
\section{Introduction}
The final sprint was focused on innovation by adding a conversational assistant via Telegram. The goal was to allow users to perform simple actions, like creating an invoice, using natural language commands from their mobile devices.

\section{Sprint Backlog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item As a user, I want to connect my account to a Telegram bot.
    \item As a user, I want to be able to say "create an invoice for client X for 500 dollars" and have a draft invoice created.
    \item As a developer, I need to set up a workflow automation tool (n8n) to orchestrate the interaction between Telegram and my backend.
    \item As a developer, I need to integrate an AI service to parse natural language into structured data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design and Implementation}
\subsection{Telegram Bot Setup}
A new bot was created on Telegram using the BotFather, and its API token was obtained.

\subsection{n8n Workflow}
A new workflow was designed in n8n. The workflow is triggered by an incoming message on Telegram. It then sends the message to an OpenAI node for natural language processing. The AI is prompted to extract the intent and entities (e.g., action, client name, amount) and return a JSON object.

\subsection{Backend Integration}
The n8n workflow then makes a call to the backend API (`POST /api/invoices`) with the structured data to create the invoice. The workflow handles user session management to associate the Telegram user with their account in the application.

\section{Sprint Review}
This sprint successfully delivered a powerful and innovative feature. The conversational assistant worked as expected, though "prompt engineering" for the AI node required several iterations to become reliable. The integration between the different services (Telegram, n8n, OpenAI, and the Spring backend) was the most complex part of this sprint.
